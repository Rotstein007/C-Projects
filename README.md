# C-Projects

Here are all my *public* C-Projects combined, which I'm updating soonâ„¢ :)

Short list of things you can find here:

- Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem
- Calculate some basic math
- Using lots of libraries (some are custom)
- Testing some functions and trying to get them work ...
- Using a window for graphic creation
- & some more :-)

If someone have any Idea or tips and tricks, you can show me ;-)
